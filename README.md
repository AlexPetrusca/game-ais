  * minimax algorithm + alpha-beta pruning
  * heuristic that accounts for the value of each piece and its position on the board to optimize AI
  * looks 10 moves ahead
* Connect Four:
  * minimax algorithm + alpha-beta pruning
  * heuristic that values moves which lead to more future 3-in-a-row and 4-in-a-row scenarios to optimize AI
  * looks 8 moves ahead
* Twenty-One: 
  * looks ahead to the end of the game
